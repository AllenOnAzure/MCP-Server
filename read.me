This script creates a Microsoft Learn MCP server inside a Docker container that allows Claude AI to search Microsoft documentation. It sets up a Node.js server that communicates with Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), listens for search requests, and returns Microsoft Learn search results. Once configured in Claude Desktop, you can ask Claude to search Microsoft Learn topics, and it will use this container to fetch documentation links and information.
